Total implementation time: 6 weeks (30 working days)

## 8. Implementation Strategy

The implementation will follow these strategic principles:

1. **Incremental Development**
   - Implement features in order of priority and dependency
   - Ensure each component is functional before moving to dependent components
   - Release working versions early and often

2. **Testing-Driven Approach**
   - Create tests alongside component development
   - Use test-driven development for complex components
   - Maintain high test coverage for critical functionality

3. **Modular Architecture**
   - Develop components with clear boundaries and interfaces
   - Ensure each module can be tested independently
   - Allow for easy replacement or enhancement of individual components

4. **Documentation-First Mindset**
   - Document component design before implementation
   - Update documentation as implementation proceeds
   - Ensure code is well-commented and readable

5. **Continuous Integration**
   - Regularly integrate components to ensure compatibility
   - Perform integration testing after significant changes
   - Maintain a working system throughout development

By following this implementation plan, the Binance Listing Tracker will be developed systematically and efficiently, resulting in a robust and valuable tool for cryptocurrency investment analysis.
