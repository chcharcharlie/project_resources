## Project Status

**Current Phase:** Architecture Design  
**Last Updated:** 2025-03-31  
**Overall Progress:** 20%  

## Phase Progress

| Phase | Status | Progress | Estimated Completion |
|-------|--------|----------|----------------------|
| Requirements Gathering | Complete | 100% | 2025-03-31 |
| Architecture Design | In Progress | 90% | 2025-03-31 |
| Foundation Layer | Not Started | 0% | TBD |
| Core Components | Not Started | 0% | TBD |
| Advanced Features | Not Started | 0% | TBD |
| Testing & Refinement | Not Started | 0% | TBD |
| Production Deployment | Not Started | 0% | TBD |

## Recent Achievements

1. Completed detailed Product Requirements Document (PRD)
2. Designed comprehensive system architecture with all major components
3. Created detailed component specifications with implementation approaches
4. Developed multi-tiered data collection strategy
5. Created AI-based analysis framework
6. Defined implementation plan with task breakdown and timeline

## Next Steps

1. Begin implementation of Foundation Layer:
   - Project skeleton and environment setup
   - Configuration management system
   - Database schema and models
   - Repository layer implementation

2. Initialize development environment:
   - Set up virtual environment
   - Install required dependencies
   - Configure development tools

## Current Challenges

1. **Data Availability for New Listings**: Need to confirm which data sources will have information immediately after a listing is announced
2. **AI Integration Complexity**: Need to refine AI prompting strategy for optimal analysis results
3. **Real-time Requirements**: System needs to process announcements and provide analysis quickly after listings appear

## Resources Allocation

| Resource | Allocation | Notes |
|----------|------------|-------|
| Development Time | 6 weeks | As per implementation plan |
| External APIs | As needed | May require paid subscriptions for some data sources |
| Infrastructure | Minimal | Small VPS or similar for deployment |
