## Implementation Notes

1. The data collection system has been designed with resilience in mind, with each collector implementing backup strategies when primary sources fail.
2. The AI analysis service provides fallback analysis when AI is unavailable or fails to produce valid results.
3. The notification service formats messages based on the confidence level of the analysis to ensure users have appropriate context.
4. Docker configuration allows for easy deployment and management in production environments.
5. The modular architecture allows for easy addition of new data sources or notification channels in the future.
