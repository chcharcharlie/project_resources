# Web Inspector MCP Server - Executive Request

## Project Overview
Build an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that wraps an existing web inspection API to help Claude users fetch webpage contents when they encounter blocks. The MCP server will act as an API wrapper around an existing distributed browser extension network.

## Business Objectives
- Provide Claude users with a reliable way to fetch webpage content when blocked
- Leverage existing infrastructure of distributed browser extensions with real human IPs
- Create a simple, easy-to-use MCP tool for webpage inspection

## Technical Requirements
1. **API Integration**
   - Endpoint: `placeholder.ai/fetch_webpage` (placeholder for actual endpoint)
   - Authentication: API key in request headers
   - Request format: List of URLs
   - Response format: List of HTML strings (one per URL)

2. **MCP Server Specifications**
   - Single tool: `fetch_webpage`
   - Parameters: List of URLs, API key
   - Synchronous operation (1-few seconds typical response time)
   - Latest MCP SDK version
   - TypeScript implementation

3. **Error Handling**
   - Return failure messages on timeout or error
   - No retry logic initially
   - Simple, clear error reporting

4. **Scope Limitations (for MVP)**
   - No caching
   - No rate limiting
   - No browser configuration options
   - No asynchronous/polling mechanism

## Success Metrics
- Successfully fetches webpage content through the MCP interface
- Handles errors gracefully
- Easy to configure and use for Claude users
- Clean, maintainable codebase

## Future Enhancements (not in initial scope)
- Additional parameters for browser configuration
- Caching mechanism
- Rate limiting and usage tracking
- Asynchronous operation with polling
- Multiple tools for different inspection types
