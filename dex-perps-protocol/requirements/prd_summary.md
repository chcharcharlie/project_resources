# PRD Summary - DEX Perpetual Contracts Protocol

## Document Overview
The Product Requirements Document (PRD) has been completed with comprehensive specifications for your decentralized perpetual contracts exchange. The document is 1089 lines and covers every aspect of the system in detail.

## Key Sections Included

### 1. Feature Specifications
- **Order Book System**: Market orders, limit orders, post-only orders with full matching engine specs
- **Perpetual Mechanics**: Detailed funding rate formula with 3x adjustment factor for faster convergence
- **Margin System**: 100x leverage with dynamic tiers, isolated margin mode
- **Liquidation Engine**: Hybrid partial/full liquidation with 1.5% penalty
- **Collateral Management**: USDC, USDT, DAI with appropriate haircuts
- **Oracle System**: Multi-oracle aggregation with outlier rejection
- **Risk Management**: Position limits, circuit breakers, emergency controls

### 2. User Workflows
Complete step-by-step workflows for:
- **Traders**: Opening/closing positions, managing margin
- **Liquidators**: Monitoring and executing liquidations  
- **Market Makers**: Providing liquidity with post-only orders

### 3. Technical Specifications
- **Smart Contract Architecture**: Modular design with 8 core contracts
- **Data Models**: Detailed structures for markets, orders, positions
- **Event Schema**: Comprehensive event logging for all actions
- **Storage Optimization**: Packed structs and gas-efficient patterns

### 4. Implementation Details
- **5-Phase Development Plan**: 6-month timeline to mainnet
- **Testing Strategy**: Unit, integration, and security testing
- **Deployment Strategy**: Testnet first, gradual mainnet rollout

## Key Design Decisions Specified

1. **Order Matching**: Price-time priority (FIFO) algorithm
2. **Funding Rate**: Modified formula with 3x premium adjustment
3. **Liquidation Split**: Partial for >$50k positions, full for smaller
4. **Margin Requirements**: 1% initial, 0.6% maintenance for 100x leverage
5. **Fee Structure**: 0.02% maker, 0.05% taker
6. **Oracle Aggregation**: Median-based outlier rejection with weighted averaging

## Retail-Focused Considerations

While the backend is sophisticated, the PRD acknowledges:
- Target users are retail traders (Robinhood-like positioning)
- Separate mobile UI will simplify the experience
- Smart contracts support all complex features for professional traders
- System designed to handle high retail volume ($5B daily target)

## Next Steps

With the PRD complete, the next phase would be:
1. **Software Architecture Design**: Technical implementation planning
2. **Component Design**: Breaking down into AI-implementable units
3. **Technology Stack Selection**: Finalizing chain and tools
4. **Security Architecture**: Designing comprehensive security measures
