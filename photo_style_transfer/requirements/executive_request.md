# Photo Style Transfer - Executive Request

## Project Overview
Create a web application that allows users to stylize their photos using Adobe Lightroom APIs by matching them to example photos. The application will analyze both the example photos and the photos to be edited, determine the appropriate Lightroom adjustments, and apply them to achieve a consistent style.

## Key Requirements

### User Scenarios
1. **Random User Scenario**: A user finds a photo online with a style they like and wants to apply that style to their own similar photos.
2. **Professional Photographer Scenario**: An independent photographer who wants to apply a consistent style to a batch of photos without manual adjustments.

### Core Functionality
1. **Photo Upload**: Allow users to upload both example photos and photos to be edited.
2. **Style Analysis**: Use an LLM to analyze the example photos and understand the desired style/vibe.
3. **Style Description**: Describe the identified style to the user.
4. **User Feedback**: (Optional) Allow users to chat with the system to refine the style understanding.
5. **Edit Determination**: Have the LLM analyze the photos to be edited and determine the exact Lightroom adjustments needed.
6. **Photo Editing**: Upload photos to Lightroom and apply the determined edits using the Lightroom API.
7. **Result Presentation**: Show the edited photos to the user and allow for download.

### Technical Requirements
1. **Adobe Lightroom API Integration**: Use the Lightroom API for photo editing, focusing on adjustments like highlights, saturation, etc.
2. **LLM Integration**: Integrate with an LLM for photo analysis and edit determination.
3. **User Authentication**: Implement user sign-in functionality.
4. **Credit System**: Allow 3 free edits per user, then require purchase of additional credits.

### API References
1. [Adobe Lightroom API - Code Sample](https://developer.adobe.com/firefly-services/docs/lightroom/code-sample/)
2. [Adobe Lightroom API Documentation](https://developer.adobe.com/lightroom/lightroom-api-docs/api/)

## Constraints
1. Edits are limited to Adobe Lightroom capabilities (no complex Photoshop manipulations).
2. The system requires integration with a configured Lightroom account.

## Success Criteria
1. Users can successfully upload photos and receive stylized versions.
2. The style transfer is accurate and matches the example photos.
3. The user interface is intuitive and easy to use.
4. The credit system works correctly.
